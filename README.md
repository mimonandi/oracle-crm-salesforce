Hello everyone,
Here in this github assignment as consulted, I have provided a project file for all. Also in the docs folder, there is a study guide. Even if you see thoroughly, I have given various links and books that I have used to master Oracle and Salesforce. I will 'be updating them on a weekly basis. Kindly go through them and inform about how knowledgeable they are all. You would find that all of them are under the Oracle websites. First create an account in Oracle and then login with your credentials to access them all. You can even download the books. To sum up, you would get access to hundreds of documents and vidoes if you would follow the processes and techniques that I have discussed under the docs as well as this main branch.
Thank you All,
Soumya Deep Das
